<p class=plaintext>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services are the IM programs which you want to use
to communicate with RemindMe. Services currently supported are "AIM" (AOL Instant Messagener), "MSN" (Microsoft Instant Messagener),
and ICQ. Users can also use "EMAIL" as a service.

<p class=plaintext>Contacts that use "email" as a service are always considered "online". Any contacts listed
after an "email" contact will be ignored when reminders are delivered.

<p class=plaintext>Each service must have a properly configured login name. If you are unsure that you have
configured your login names correctly, you can read more about login names <a href="login_help.html">here</a>.
