<p class=plaintext>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users can create reminders through the RemindMe webpage or by sending
messages to the RemindMe Bot using an IM service or email. Users can communicate with the bot using any of the three 
saved contacts.

<p class=plaintext>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users can send IMs and Emails to RemindMe using AOL Instant Messagener, MSN Chat, ICQ or Email. 
You can enter up to three different contact methods in which you can communicate with RemindMe. The contact order
determines the order in which RemindMe will attempt to deliver your reminders.

<p class=plaintext>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, some people have one screen-name they use at work and another they use at home.
A user like this could set his or her work screen-name as the "first contact" and the screen-name they use at
home as the "second contact". RemindMe would first attempt to deliver any reminders to the user's work screen-name.
If the user wasn't signed on his or her work screen-name but was signed on his or home screen-name, RemindMe would
send all reminders to the home screen-name.


<p class=plaintext>* <b>NOTE</b>: Contacts that use "email" as a service are always considered "online". Any contacts listed
after an "email" contact will be ignored.
